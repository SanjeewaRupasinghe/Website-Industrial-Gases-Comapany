                        Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a liquefied, colourless gas that can asphyxiate in high concentrations.
                        There are many different sources of CO<sub>2</sub>. It can be obtained from natural CO<sub>2</sub> springs, limestone
                        kilns, fermentation processes and gas streams from chemical and petrochemical plants. It can
                        also be captured from the gas streams emitted by power plants

                        Carbon dioxide has many well-known applications in the food and beverages industry – from
                        carbonating drinks and conserving wine to modifying atmospheres for packaged foods. Dry ice – or
                        solid CO<sub>2</sub> – is commonly used for storage and transportation of temperature sensitive products
                        such as frozen/chilled foods or medical/ pharmaceutical materials. Dry ice is used as a process
                        coolant in food, chemicals, research and pharmaceutical industries and is also an extremely
                        effective and environmentally sound cleaning agent. In agriculture, CO<sub>2</sub> can be used to enhance
                        growth in greenhouses and as a feedstock for algae that produce bio-oil (green crude).

                        The non-flammable properties of CO<sub>2</sub> make it a popular pressurising gas for everything from
                        aerosols through fumigants to air guns. It has many other uses – including as a component of
                        medical reanimation mixtures, a neutralizing agent for pH control, an inerting agent for mild
                        steel welding, a replacement for blasting powder in quarrying and mining operations in
                        compressed form and a blasting agent in solid form. Liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is growing in popularity as a
                        cryogenic refrigerant in mechanical refrigeration systems due to its environmental benefits.

                        CO<sub>2</sub> is also employed for the chemical vapour deposition of silicon dioxide, active laser
                        mixtures, Coleman nitrogen analysers, foam blowing, pulp washing, car emissions monitoring and
                        environmental monitoring, fire extinguishing, surgery and sterilising, blood analysis, sample
                        preparation, chromatography and the production of paints and varnishes.

                        We deliver gaseous, liquid and solid carbon dioxide in a variety of cylinders, vessels and
                        containers to fit your precise application needs.
