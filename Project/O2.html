                        Oxygen (O2) is a colourless and odourless gas. It is vital for most life forms on earth. We
                        absorb oxygen through the air we breathe. Medical oxygen is essential in hospital and clinical
                        care for resuscitation and surgery and for various therapies. It is also mixed with nitrogen or
                        helium to create underwater diving mixtures.

                        Oxygen is obtained on a commercial scale through the liquefaction and distillation of ambient
                        air at air separation plants. A second purification process may be necessary if ultra-high
                        purity levels are required. High-purity oxygen can also be produced through the electrolysis of
                        water. Membrane techniques are suited to lower-purity requirements.

                        The main industrial application of oxygen is combustion. Many materials that do not normally
                        burn in air will burn in oxygen so mixing oxygen with air greatly enhances combustion efficiency
                        in iron and steel, non-ferrous, glass and concrete industries. It is widely combined with a fuel
                        gas for cutting, welding, brazing and glass blowing, offering much higher flame temperatures and
                        thus greater efficiency than just air. With oxyfuel, plasma and laser processes, a jet of
                        gaseous oxygen is used to cut steel. Oxygen is also popular in thermal lancing to drill or cut
                        through materials such as concrete, brick, stone and various metals.

                        Due to its ability to help stabilise the arc and reduce surface tension, oxygen is used as an
                        ingredient in some shielding gas mixtures. The chemical industry relies on pure oxygen to
                        increase the efficiency of oxidation reactions, for instance. High-purity oxygen is used in
                        laboratories, process-control operations, gas-cooled nuclear reactors, metal analysis
                        instruments, and in semiconductor and optical fibre production.

                        On the water treatment front, oxygen is an effective way of purifying waste water and treating
                        sewage. Other applications include sealing glass ampoules in the pharmaceutical industry,
                        oxygenation of water for aquaculture, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) mixtures and liquid
                        explosives.
